# Quick start
Requires the Light Field Toolbox for MATLAB v0.4 available here: https://goo.gl/RHe4hR

Run DemoLFSynth.m. It should generate a light field in a few seconds, and display it using the interactive LFDispMousePan function.

For further information please see the header comments in DemoLFSynth.m.
